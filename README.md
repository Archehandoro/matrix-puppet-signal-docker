# matrix-puppet-signal-docker

Docker image for matrix-puppet-signal. Fork from icewind1991/matrix-puppet-signal-docker and based on matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-signal. You will need an iOS or Android device to link Signal to the bridge. Make 

## Usage

- Download the [sample config](https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-signal/blob/master/config.sample.json)
- Fill in your personal config and rename to `config.json`
- Start signal link process `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/config.json:/conf/config.json -v $(pwd)/data:/data icewind1991/matrix-puppet-signal-docker link`
- Scan the QR code with signal on your phone to finish registration. In job 136 after linking the device, the image will freeze. You can safely exit with Ctrl+C.
- Generate `signal-registration.yaml` using `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/config.json:/conf/config.json icewind1991/matrix-puppet-signal-docker registration "http://matrix-signal:8090"`
- The output of `signal-registration.yaml` will appear on console. Copy it and create a signal-registration.yaml file on the same directory.
- Run the container with `docker run -it -v $(pwd)/config.json:/conf/config.json icewind1991/matrix-puppet-signal-docker`

## Usage with spantaleev/docker-ansible-matrix-deploy

- Create directories /matrix/bridge-signal/config/ and /matrix/bridge-signal/data as per the docker-compose file structure. You can change this, but decided to go this way for ease of use and potential integration with the Ansible playbook from spantaleev. Make sure the files have matrix:matrix as owner.
- Copy config.json and signal-registration.yaml onto /matrix/bridge-signal/config/ Also double check that ownership of the file is matrix:matrix
- Run the bridge with docker-compose from the repository.
- In the playbook, navigate to roles/matrix-synapse/defaults/main.yml and in variables matrix_synapse_container_additional_volumes: and matrix_synapse_container_additional_volumes: enter the following info:

`matrix_synapse_container_additional_volumes: - {"src": "/matrix/bridge-signal/config/signal-registration.yaml", "dst": "/signal-registration.yaml", "options": "ro"}`

`matrix_synapse_container_additional_volumes: - {"src": "/matrix/bridge-signal/config/signal-registration.yaml", "dst": "/signal-registration.yaml", "options": "ro"}`

- Please note that the - before { in both values is included.
- Restart the playbook.
